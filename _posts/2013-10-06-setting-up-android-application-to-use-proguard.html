Results can be seen <a href="http://proguard.sourceforge.net/#results.html">here</a>.</li><li>Obfuscates code so that it is slightly harder for someone to understand your code.</li><li>Can automatically remove Log statements and other debugging code.</li></ol><p>When an Android project is created, a proguard-project.txt is created in the project's folder.  This file should contain all the arguments that are required to be passed to proguard.</p><p> </p>
