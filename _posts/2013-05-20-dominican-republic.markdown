Where we stayed
------------
We stayed at a resort called Casa Colonial. The resort is designed like a colonial villa and is located right on the beach. It is located, along with many other resorts in a walled area called Playa Dorado. The Playa contains everything a tourist would need for the duration of their stay, including a pharmacy, restaurants, shopping center etc.  Pulling up at the entrance one will immediately realize that this resort is a class above every other resort in Puerto Plata. Designed as a boutique resort, Casa Colonial is beautiful, serene and modern. We aren't early morning people but we felt like waking up every morning to take in every minute of the beach, birds and tropical foliage. The resort truly has a calming ambiance. There is also a very good spa, pool and Jacuzzi. There is waiter service available on the beach so you can sip away on lagers and cocktails on the beach while lazing out to reggae. The staff at Casa Colonial and the people in DR in general is very friendly and helpful.

##### The beach at Casa Colonial

Casa Colonial has two restaurants - The Verandah is open for breakfast till 6pm and Lucia is open from 6pm for dinner. The food at both these restaurants is very delicious, The chef is fantastic and we really enjoyed every morsel. We tried a few local restaurants to get a taste of the local cuisine but we didn't really connect with it since neither of us enjoys seafood very much. But thanks to the restaurants at the resort we were never far away from mouth-watering food. Two dishes that stood out were - skirt steak at Lucia and Linguine with grilled shrimp and garlic at the Verandah.

##### Skirt Steak at Lucia

Unlike most resorts in Dominican Republic Casa Colonial doesn't have an all included plan, though you can purchase it separately at the hotel (about 125$ per person per day)

What we did
------------
The first day we just chilled at the beach, went to the spa for a very relaxing couples massage and lounged in the Jacuzzi.

The next day we went to Damajagua or the 27 waterfalls, as it is more famously known. Here is a youtube video of the experience.

The cab to and from Damajagua to Puerto Plata costs about 80$. The ticket to the waterfalls are pretty cheap- 8-16$ per person depending on how many waterfalls are chosen. We chose to jump 7 waterfalls. The rush was extraordinary and the entire time we had a lot of fun. Because we went on a weekday there wasn't too much of a crowd and we could jump each waterfall multiple times without waiting for anyone. But with a tour group or on a weekend it might not be as much fun. We didn't take our camera because of the water but the guide insisted that he could keep any camera safe in a plastic bag , a big risk for some rewarding pictures and videos.

The third day we went to Cayo Arena or Paradise Island as it is more famously known? Paradise Island is an island west of Puerto Plata near Punta Rucia. On arrival at Punta Rucia the turquoise water and white sands take one aback. Paradise Island is small island , about 200 sq meters(240 sq yds)  in area and is surrounded by shallow water and fish, a snorkelers dream. We went with a tour group of about 20 people and paid about 150$ for the both of us. The touring company picked us up from the hotel, provided fruits and liquor at Paradise Island,  lunch on the way back and dropped us off at the hotel. The trip overall was breathtaking though it took about 10 hours for the whole trip.It can get crowded on the island on the weekends It is very sunny on the island and sun block is a must.

##### Paradise Island ( Cayo Arena )

TL;DR
------
<ul>
	<li>USD accepted everywhere and one doesn't need to worry about local currency.</li>
	<li>Tourists have to pay about 30% of tax on nearly everything including food, shopping and stay.If the menu says 40$, its going to cost 50$ after taxes.</li>
	<li>Spanish is the local language and not a lot of people speak english. Learn some basic spanish or get a translator app with offline capabilities.(We used Microsoft's translator for Windows Phone).</li>
</ul>
